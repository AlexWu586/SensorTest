# SensorTest
The sensor test made with Unity and Android Studio.

Unity version: 2022.3.0f1
Import this package and open "Sensor" scene.
Build the project and install it in your cellphone.
If your cellphone platform is Android, you can download the "Sensor.apk" directly and intall it.
Make sure two devices which installed the app are already paired, because this app only finds bonding devices.
Make sure one device becomes the server first, and then another device becomes the client for connectivity.
